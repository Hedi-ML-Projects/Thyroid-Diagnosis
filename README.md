# Thyroid-Diagnosis
Approximately 200 million people in the world have one of the thyroid disease categories. In Canada a large number of people  are affected. Recent studies have revealed that 1 in 10 Canadians suffer from a thyroid condition of one type or another! Of those, as many as 50% are undiagnosed! (based on data in https://thyroid.ca/)
Main types of Thyroid:
Types of Thyroid problem:
1) Hypothyroidism: The thyroid fails to make enough thyroid hormones and slows down many of your body's functions

2) Hyperthyroidism: The thyroid makes more thyroid hormone than the body needs, which speeds up many of your body's functions.

### Objective of the project:
The main purpose of this project is to develop a system which can warn the physicians about the cases susceptible to Thyroid. As the model is used for medical applications it should be as precise and sensitive as possible. In other words, we intend to have the least false negative (least number of real thyroid cases that are not diagnosed) and least false positive rates (least number of healthy cases that are diagnosed as having thyroid). 
In this project I have used an SVM classifier to assign hyperthyroid, hypothyroid and negative labels to the test samples based on the data provided by the training set. The data set is Thyroid which is available on the UCI machine learning repository.
